## FAQ

#### How do I import the annotations to spaCy?

A guide is available [here](https://github.com/tecoholic/ner-annotator/issues/44#issuecomment-1159235765).

#### I have multiple exported annotations. How do I combined them into one file?

A guide is available [here](https://github.com/tecoholic/ner-annotator/discussions/81#discussioncomment-5287891).

#### What tagging format does the tool use?

The JSON file created by the tool is generic and simply lists the start and end of each entity. As such, the annotations are independent of the tagging format you intend to use (IO, IOB, IOBES, etc.).
