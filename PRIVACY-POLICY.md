# Privacy Policy

NER Annotator is designed to be a "tool" and not a "service". The tool is designed to be used without any external dependencies, including any dependency on network communication or data (including private data). The privacy policy is included for the sole purpose of making this explicit, as a version of the tool is hosted as a web application at https://tecoholic.github.io/ner-annotator/, which might be seen as a "service". This is NOT the only way to use this tool. NER Annotator can also be built into a desktop application which doesn't require any hosting. It is strongly recommended to build and/or host a copy of this on your infrastructure.

## Terms

NER Annotator does not collect any data.

Your documents and annotations are stored either on your device for the desktop version or in your browser's local storage for the web version. They never leave your device. The tool does not transmit your data elsewhere.

The tool does not include any form of analytics or usage tracking software that could transmit your data to third-party servers. It does not collect any metadata such as IP addresses, browser versions, etc. It does not use cookies.

If you have further concerns about how the tool manages your data, you are requested to review the code or build the tool from scratch following the instructions provided in the [README file](./README.md). This is an open-source tool.

It should be noted that this tool is released under the [MIT license](./LICENSE). The license grants you permission to use this tool without restrictions. The tool is provided "as is" without any warranty. The authors of the tool cannot be held liable for any claims arising from the use of the tool.
